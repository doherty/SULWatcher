=== INSTALL ===

You'll need MySQL and python.

1)  Create a database for this bot.
2)  In MySQL:
        CREATE DATABASE <name>
3)  Open SULWatcher.sql and replace all occurences of p_stewardbots_sulwatcher with the name of 
    your database.
    Execute SULWatcher.sql, in MySQL:
        SOURCE SULWatcher.sql
4)  (optional) To convert an old .ini configuration to a database configuration:
    Open ini2mysql.py and replace all occurences of p_stewardbots_sulwatcher with the name of
    your database.
    Execute ini2mysql.py:
        python ini2mysql.py
    
=== BACKUP ===

To backup the database execute:
    mysqldump <name> > <name>.sql
    
You can then re-import the database with:
    mysql <name> < <name>.sql
    
=== Database layout ===
The bot uses three tables to store its setup, regexes and log hits. At the
toolserver these tables are in p_stewardbots_sulwatcher on sql-s3.

Setup is stored in "setup", regexes in "regex" and logging is done in
"logging". The table "unique_logging" is a [[View (database)|view]] on
"logging" used by http://toolserver.org/~stewardbots/SULWatcher/, it is not
used by the IRC bot itself.
